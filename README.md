# Media Library Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that, in tandem with Sabnzbd, Radarr, Sonarr, ffmpeg, Telegram, and ClamAV keep my Plex library fed with content.

If you know what these scripts are for, because everything is garbage and nothing works correctly and you now have to roll your own, you are welcome to take one for personal use, or use it as a launching pad to solve your problem.
